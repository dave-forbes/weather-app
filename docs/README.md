# weather-app

From Odin Project, an app that fetches displays current weather where the user is using a free weather API. You can also search current weather for anywhere else or get weather for a random place in the world.

# Conclusion

Another project to practise using apis and asynchronus functions, I have a more solid grasp of this topic now. Was fun to add in extra functionality like weather from a random location as well as displaying the relative time in different locations and updating background to display if its night or day there.

Features

- Fetch and display current weather for users location and any other location as well as extra info including time of day.
- Simple UI for easy navigation.
- Background changes depending on location night or day.
