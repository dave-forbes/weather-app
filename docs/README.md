# Technologies used 

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

# Conclusion

Another project to practise using apis and asynchronus functions, I have a more solid grasp of this topic now. Was fun to add in extra functionality like the loading 'gif' and picture API request for background. 

# TODO 

* Debug type error when calling loadingGif function
* adjust display weather data function to make it more readable in javascript and when displayed on the page
* add functionality to request the forecast for next n days 
* Can't search for very specific locations yet, add in lat and long or map search in future. 
* Sometimes photos aren't very good/apropriate for specific locations, especially less well known locations.
